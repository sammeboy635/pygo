src/lexer.rs: Implement the lexer, which turns the input source code into a sequence of tokens. This is the first step in the compilation process, and it's necessary for parsing the code correctly.

src/parser.rs: Implement the parser, which turns the token stream generated by the lexer into an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST represents the structure of the program in a way that's easier to analyze and transform.

src/ast.rs: Define the AST data structures and types used in your programming language. This involves creating data structures that represent the different kinds of expressions, statements, and other language constructs that your language supports.

src/typechecker.rs: Implement the type checker, which verifies that the types of expressions and values in the program are consistent and correct. This involves defining the rules for type inference and type checking in your language.

src/semantic_analyzer.rs: Implement the semantic analyzer, which analyzes the AST and checks for semantic errors that can't be caught by the type checker. This includes things like checking for undefined variables or functions, ensuring that control flow statements are used correctly, and enforcing scoping rules.

src/codegen.rs: Implement the code generator, which takes the AST and generates executable code. This is the final step in the compilation process, and it involves generating the machine code that corresponds to the high-level constructs in the AST.

src/standard_library.rs: Implement the standard library for your programming language. This includes providing implementations for common functions and data types that are available to users of your language.

tests/unit/: Write unit tests for the different modules and functions in your implementation. Unit tests help ensure that each individual part of your program works as expected.

tests/integration/: Write integration tests that test the end-to-end behavior of your programming language. This involves running example programs and checking that they produce the expected output.

examples/: Write example programs that demonstrate the features of your programming language.


Study both languages: Before you start implementing PyGo, make sure you have a deep understanding of Python and Go, especially their syntax and concurrency features. This will help you identify the best parts of each language to incorporate into PyGo.

Define the syntax: Begin by outlining the syntax of PyGo. You'll want to retain Python's readability and simplicity while integrating Go's concurrent features. Decide which aspects of Python's syntax to keep, and how to incorporate Go's features such as goroutines and channels.

Design the concurrency model: One of Go's strengths is its built-in concurrency model, which uses lightweight threads called goroutines, and channels for communication between them. Plan how you'll incorporate this into PyGo, ensuring you maintain Python's ease of use.

Create a lexer and parser: Develop a lexer to tokenize the source code and a parser to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokenized input. These components will be the foundation of your language's compiler or interpreter.

Build a compiler or interpreter: Decide whether you want PyGo to be a compiled or interpreted language. If you opt for a compiler, you'll need to convert the AST into an executable binary or bytecode. For an interpreter, you'll execute the AST directly.

Implement the standard library: Define and implement a standard library for PyGo, including common data structures, functions, and modules. This will provide users with a familiar and useful toolkit for building applications.

Write documentation: Create comprehensive documentation for PyGo, including a language reference, tutorials, and examples. This will help users get started with the language and make it more accessible.

Develop an IDE or plugins: To make PyGo even more user-friendly, consider creating an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or plugins for popular editors like Visual Studio Code or Atom.

Gather feedback and iterate: Share PyGo with the programming community to get feedback and make improvements. Be prepared to revise and refine your language based on user feedback and your own experiences using it.

Build a community: Encourage others to use, contribute to, and support PyGo. Establish a community forum, mailing list, or social media presence to facilitate discussion and collaboration.
